# Django Recipe App API

This is a Django REST Framework-based API project for managing recipes. The goal of this project is to refresh my knowledge of Django, with a specific focus on **Django REST Framework**. Through this project, I have explored and implemented various features such as **AbstractUser** for custom user models, and made modifications to the **Django admin panel** to improve its structure and usability.

Previously, I primarily worked with class-based views, writing the logic myself, but in this project, I have transitioned to using **viewsets** and **generics**, which streamline the process of building APIs. Additionally, I am using **Test Driven Development (TDD)** to ensure that all features are tested before implementation, which helps maintain code quality and reliability.

To further enhance the development process, I have **Dockerized** the application, ensuring consistency across environments and simplifying deployment. Moreover, I have integrated **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), automating the testing and deployment pipelines to streamline the development workflow.

This project not only serves as a practical exercise but also reinforces key concepts in modern Django development, helping me stay up to date with industry practices.
